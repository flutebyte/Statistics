# Student Rating Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook performs an analysis of a simulated Student Rating Dataset. The dataset contains information about professorsâ€™ age, gender, minority status, tenure, and student evaluation scores. The main goal of this analysis is to answer specific questions about tenure, demographics, and evaluation trends using Python visualization and statistical tools.

## Dataset
Since the exact Kaggle dataset was not available, a simulated dataset was created with the following columns:

- `age` : Age of the professor
- `gender` : Gender of the professor (Male/Female)
- `minority` : Whether the professor belongs to a visible minority (Yes/No)
- `tenure` : Tenure status (Yes/No)
- `eval` : Student evaluation score (2.5 - 5.0 scale)

The dataset contains 50 sample entries, designed to reflect realistic distributions.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Percentage of visible minorities who are tenured**
   - Calculates the proportion of minority professors holding tenure.
   - Provides insights into whether tenure status differs based on minority status.

2. **Average age by tenure**
   - Computes the mean and standard deviation of age for tenured and non-tenured professors.
   - Helps to understand whether tenure correlates with age.

3. **Age distribution graph**
   - Visualizes age using a histogram to understand spread and distribution.
   - Histogram chosen over boxplot for clarity of distribution.

4. **Gender distribution**
   - Explains the difference between `pyplot.bar` (vertical) and `pyplot.barh` (horizontal) plots.
   - Plots the gender distribution of professors using a bar chart.

5. **Median evaluation score for tenured professors**
   - Calculates the median student evaluation score among tenured faculty.
   - Provides insight into how tenured professors are rated by students.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas` : For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` : For numerical operations and data simulation
- `matplotlib` : For plotting graphs
- `seaborn` : For enhanced visualization style

## How to Use
1. Open the `StudentRatingAnalysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run each cell sequentially to see outputs and visualizations.
3. All graphs and statistics are generated from the simulated dataset included in the notebook.

## Notes
- This analysis uses a simulated dataset for educational purposes.
- The notebook is structured with explanations and comments for clarity and understanding.
- The results are reproducible by setting a random seed (`np.random.seed(42)`).
