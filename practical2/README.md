# Practical 2 â€“ Statistics  

This practical explores key statistical concepts using Python and simulated datasets.  
The exercises focus on identifying data types, summarizing distributions, and visualizing relationships using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## ðŸ“˜ Questions Overview

### **Q1. Time Series vs Cross-Sectional Data**
- Identified that the *Teachers Rating Data* is **cross-sectional**, as it captures multiple entities (teachers) at one point in time, not across time.

### **Q2. Descriptive Statistics for Students**
- Calculated **mean**, **median**, **minimum**, and **maximum** for the number of students using Pythonâ€™s `statistics` module.

### **Q3. Descriptive Statistics Table**
- Used `pandas.DataFrame.describe()` to summarize data for multiple subjects (Math, Science, English, History).

### **Q4. Histogram of Beauty Variable**
- Created a histogram of the *beauty* variable to visualize its distribution using `matplotlib`.

### **Q5. Gender Difference in Beauty Scores**
- Computed **mean** and **standard deviation** of beauty scores grouped by gender to check if average scores differ between male and female instructors.

### **Q6. Tenure Status by Gender**
- Calculated percentage of tenured male and female professors.
- Found a gender-based difference in tenure proportions within the dataset.

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statistics`
- `random`

## ðŸ§  Insights
- The dataset is cross-sectional, not time-series.  
- Beauty scores and tenure status may vary by gender, highlighting potential biases or distributional differences.  
- Visualization and descriptive statistics provide deeper understanding of dataset characteristics.
